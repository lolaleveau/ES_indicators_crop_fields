The review from Boerema et al. (2016) includes 16 provisioning and regulating ecosystem services, whose names were chosen based on previous reviews about ecosystem services indicators. To enhance the transferability of our indicators collection to scientists and stakeholders working with various historical or regional frameworks, we linked these ecosystem services names to two internationally acknowledged classifications, that were cited as inspirations by Boerema et al. (2016): The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) classification and the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) at the group level (Haines-Young & Potschin, 2013b; TEEB, 2010). 

We achieved this linkage using a web-based classification tool from the HUGIN OpenNESS project, that gives conditional probabilities of correspondence between ecosystem service categories in different classifications via a bayesian belief network. Because CICES and TEEB classifications do not align perfectly, an ecosystem service in one classification can be more general than in another. Consequently, one ecosystem service from Boerema et al. (2016) may correspond to multiple ecosystem services in a given classification .
